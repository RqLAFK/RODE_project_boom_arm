### Background
RØDE  released  the  PSA1  microphone  boom  arm in 2008,  as  a  versatile desk  mount  for broadcast microphones, which quickly became one of the company’s highest selling accessories. The PSA1+ then  came  in  2021,  offering  a  more  premium  solution  however  it  was  still  based  on  a  traditional spring-mount  platform,  which  has  significant  limitations  on payload  limits  (both  minimum  and maximum) and a less elegant user experience when compared to other systems.RØDE would like to engineer a boom arm that provides users with a premium experience, allowing them to position microphones of a significantly wide weight range with ease and ensure they stay in place over time.The project requires the design of a commercially viable microphone boom arm based on a hydraulic system.

### Objectives
An ideal solution would meet the following requirements:
